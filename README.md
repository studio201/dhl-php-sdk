# DHL PHP SDK

This *unofficial* library is wrapping some functions of the DHL SOAP API in order to easy create/delete shipments and labels.

## Requirements

- You need a [DHL developer Account](https://developer.dhl.com/) and - as long as you want to use the API in production systems - a DHL Geschäftskundenportal Account.
- PHP-Version 7.4 or higher _(It may work on older Versions, but I don't offer Support for these)_

## Installation

### Composer

You can use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install the package to your project:

```
composer require kruegge82/dhl-php-sdk
```

The classes are then added to the autoloader automatically.

### Without Composer

If you can't use Composer (or don't want to), you can also use this SDK without it.

To initial this SDK, just require the [_nonComposerLoader.php](https://github.com/kruegge82/dhl-php-sdk/blob/master/includes/_nonComposerLoader.php)-File from the `/includes/` directory.

```php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/includes/_nonComposerLoader.php');
```

## Compatibility

This Project is written for the DHL-REST-API **Version 2.1.1 or higher**.

If you like this Project may consider to [Donate](https://www.paypal.me/jahn82). I usually do this Project in my spare time and it's completely free.
